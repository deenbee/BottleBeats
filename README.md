# BottleBeats
Welcome to the future of music production! I’m thrilled to introduce Bottle Beats 0.2.3 , a brand-new open-source Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) built using PyGame and SoundDevice . This project is still in active development, but it’s already showing immense potential to compete with popular DAWs like LMMS Studio .

This software started as a base framework created by Grok3 , and over time, we’ve been refining and improving the code to make it more functional and user-friendly. After just one month of development, this version is already shaping up to be a powerful tool for musicians, producers, and developers alike.

I’m incredibly excited to share this project with you all, and I’ll soon be uploading the source code to GitHub so that everyone can access, use, and contribute to its growth. Whether you’re into retro-inspired beats, experimental sound design, or just love open-source projects, Bottle Beats 0.2.3 is here to inspire creativity.

Stay tuned for updates, and don’t forget to subscribe to support this project and keep up with its progress. Together, we can build something truly special for the music production community!
